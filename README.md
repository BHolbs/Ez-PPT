# Ez-PDF
A WPF tool to scaffold a PowerPoint presentation, without ever opening PowerPoint! (At least not until the end.)

# Requirements
- .NET Framework 4.8
- Some version of Microsoft PowerPoint installed.

# Downloading and Running

The release for Ez PPT can be found [here.](https://github.com/BHolbs/Ez-PPT/tree/main/Ez-PPT/bin/Release)

**YOU MUST DOWNLOAD THE CONTENTS OF THE ENTIRE RELEASE FOLDER IN ORDER FOR EZ PPT TO RUN PROPERLY.** If you only download the executable, the application will crash when you search for images. 

For your convenience, I've created a .zip archive containing everything in the Release folder, located [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yh2d0ID0DMNmpHMlJm7PLrtF7jMXz5fc/view?usp=sharing)
